# Efficient Duple Perturbation Robustness in Low-rank MDPs

This is the implementation of Efficient Duple Perturbation Robustness in Low-rank MDPs.


## Required packages
Required `pytorch` and other necessary like `seaborn` or `pandas`.

## Scripts of running experiments
- Random feature
  ```bash
  ./run_train_$ENV.sh
  ```
  where `$ENV` include pendulum, cartpole, pendubot, and quadrotor2d.

## Sample scripts for evaluation
